# TaskRPG
Gamified Productivity Website

## Description:
TaskRPG is a gamified productivity website designed to turn daily tasks into a rewarding experience. Drawing inspiration from retro Gameboy aesthetics, it features pixel art backgrounds and a playful interface. As users complete tasks, they earn experience points (EXP), which can be spent in a shop to unlock new themes, backgrounds, and visual upgrades. The app encourages progress through a fully customizable experience, allowing users to personalize both the website’s appearance and the Gameboy’s display. All data, including tasks, EXP, and purchased items, are saved using localStorage, ensuring continuity across sessions. TaskRPG merges task management with fun, motivating users to stay productive while engaging with nostalgic, game-like elements.
